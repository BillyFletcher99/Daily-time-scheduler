I've got good news, and bad news. The good news is, i figured out how to do the timer, and can now go back to the java quiz and redo that!
The bad news is, i think i butchered this one. I don't believe my events are saving properly to the local storage, I have not gotten my colour coding in the time slots either. The tables where easy enough to put together using some boostrap and minor tweaking, but the functionality is definitely missing in this assignment.
